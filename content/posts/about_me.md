+++
Stylianos (Stelios) Anastasakis is a technologist and researcher with a multifaceted background that bridges computational neuroscience, data science, and web software development. His career is characterized by a deep-seated passion for problem-solving, whether modeling the complexities of the human brain or building scalable web applications.

His journey began with a strong academic foundation in Physics and a Master's degree in Brain & Mind Sciences from the University of Crete. This led to significant research experience at the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), where he focused on computational modeling of neural processes, publishing peer-reviewed work on dendritic computations.

Pivoting towards applied technology, Stelios cultivated expertise in software engineering, working as a Frontend Developer for 3 years. In these roles, he developed and maintained web applications for clients like BOX Food and Acmon Data, utilizing modern frameworks such as Angular and working within Agile and CI/CD environments. His experience also includes a role as a Data Scientist at home24 in Berlin, where he applied machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.

Currently, Stelios is pursuing a new MSc in Data Analysis and Machine Statistical Learning (DAMSL) to further deepen his expertise in data-driven methods, combining his rich practical experience with advanced theoretical knowledge.
